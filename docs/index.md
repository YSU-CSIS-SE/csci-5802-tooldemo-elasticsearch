# Elasticsearch

The source code for Elasticsearch can be found on github at [https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch).

**Disclaimer:** This website discusses only Elasticsearch. It is common to use Elasticsearch as part of an Elastic stack containing [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) and [Logtash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash). Both Kibana and Logtash interact with Elasticsearch through HTTP requests. Kibana provides an easy to use UI for data visualizations and management of the Elastic stack. Logtash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources (in any format) simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite stash, in most cases Elasticsearch. In production, you should use the Elastic stack. However, this website is only concerned with Elasticsearch on its own and the syntax for various JSON HTTP requests.
