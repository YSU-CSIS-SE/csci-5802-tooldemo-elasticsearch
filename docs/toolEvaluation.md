# Elasticsearch Evaluation

**Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 with the following meanings for each rating**

1. Very bad
2. Bad
3. Neutral
4. Good
5. Very Good

| Criteria | Rating  | Reason for Rating |
|--------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| Time to install | 5 | It takes less than 30 minutes to get Elasticsearch up and running with basic command line and system path experience. |
| User friendliness | 2 | Another tool must be installed to interact with Elasticsearch, and the JSON request bodies have to be formatted exactly correct for the request to work (sometimes you can use JSON pretty format and sometimes you cannnot otherwise the request won't work).|
| Learning curve | 2 | Elasticsearch has tons of different APIs and a multitude of capabilities through these APIs and HTTP requests. To learn and understand how to accomplish a task may require complex JSON code or another tool installation to reduce the complex code. |
| UI | 3 | There are UIs available for interacting with Elasticsearch, such as Fiddler, Sense, RESTClient, or Kibana. However, they have to be installed separately from Elasticsearch. |
| Capabilities (number of uses) | 4 | Elasticsearch has tons of different APIs (see [Tutorials](tutorials.md)) and 6 different major uses (see [Uses](uses.md)), including at least 100 enterprise users (like Dell and Github). However, it doesn't have multi-language support in terms of handling request and response data. |
| Compatibility | 5 | Elasticsearch is written in Java, so it is compatible with almost every platform. |
